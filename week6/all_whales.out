Test all_whales_1 (./all_whales.pl) - passed
Test all_whales_2 (./all_whales.pl) - passed
Test all_whales_3 (./all_whales.pl) - failed (Incorrect output)

Your program produced these 10 lines of output:
beluga observations: 5 pods, 1833 individuals
cuvier\'s beaked whale observations: 2 pods, 7 individuals
false orca  observations: 1 pods, 1 individuals
humpback observations: 5 pods, 33 individuals
north atlantic right whale observations: 2 pods, 3 individuals
orca observations: 6 pods, 18 individuals
pilot whale observations: 2 pods, 127 individuals
pygmy right whale observations: 1 pods, 4 individuals
pygmy right whale  observations: 1 pods, 4 individuals
sperm whale observations: 4 pods, 8 individuals

The correct 9 lines of output for this test were:
beluga observations:  5 pods, 1833 individuals
cuvier\'s beaked whale observations:  2 pods, 7 individuals
false orca observations:  1 pods, 1 individuals
humpback observations:  5 pods, 33 individuals
north atlantic right whale observations:  2 pods, 3 individuals
orca observations:  6 pods, 18 individuals
pilot whale observations:  2 pods, 127 individuals
pygmy right whale observations:  2 pods, 8 individuals
sperm whale observations:  4 pods, 8 individuals

The difference between your output and the correct output is:
- pygmy right whale observations: 1 pods, 4 individuals
?                             ^     ^

+ pygmyrightwhaleobservations:2pods,8individuals
?                             ^     ^

- pygmy right whale  observations: 1 pods, 4 individuals
