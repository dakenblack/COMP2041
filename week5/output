Test tail_10 (-a	"./tail.pl -1 t1.txt t2.txt t3.txt") - failed (Incorrect output)

Your program produced these 3 lines of output:
Data 1 ... Last line
A one line file.
line

The correct 6 lines of output for this test were:
==> t1.txt <==
Data 1 ... Last line
==> t2.txt <==
A one line file.
==> t3.txt <==
line

The difference between your output and the correct output is:
+ ==> t1.txt <==
+ ==> t2.txt <==
+ ==> t3.txt <==

You can reproduce this test by executing these commands:

./tail.pl -1 t1.txt t2.txt t3.txt
